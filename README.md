# 2d-platformer-project beta v2.3 
this is a 2d platformer mario game but focused on pseedrunning

jobs to do:
- CREATE OWN SPRITE SHEET FOR ANIMATION AND GAME SPRITE
- add timer
- add sound and more animation
- add either multiion to level, or facade for pause menu and other control 


test version:
- to run the code go to scene folder and choose Main_alpha as root
- make sure the all_world.gd and global_player_manager.gd script in the global_helper folder of the scripts folder is loaded as global with all_world.gd loaded before global_player_manager.gd
- game use test sprite so may look janky
